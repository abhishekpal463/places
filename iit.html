                     Institutes of Technology Act. <br><br>
                     IIT Kanpur was established by an Act of Parliament in 1959. The institute was started in December
                     1959 in a room in the canteen building of the Harcourt Butler Technological Institute at Agricultural
                      Gardens in Kanpur. In 1963, the institute moved to its present location, on the Grand Trunk Road
                      near the locality of Kalyanpur in Kanpur district. <br><br>
